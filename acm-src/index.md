### About

The Student Research Competition (SRC) at PACT 2026 provides a unique opportunity for students to present their research and receive feedback from experienced researchers in the community. The SRC helps students network, strengthen communication skills, and showcase ongoing work to an audience of peers and experts. Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.

---

### Eligibility Criteria

Participants must be current students (graduate or undergraduate) at the time of submission. An active ACM student membership is required. The competition is divided into two categories:

- **Undergraduate:** Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree
- **Graduate:** Currently pursuing a master's or PhD degree

---

### Call for Papers

Submissions should include:

- **Problem and Motivation:** Clearly define the problem and explain why it matters.
- **Background and Related Work:** Provide context and key references, and explain how your work differs from prior work.
- **Approach and Uniqueness:** Describe your approach and what is novel about it.
- **Results and Contributions:** Present preliminary or current results and explain their significance to programming languages and computer science.

Submissions must be **original and unpublished** work. One of the goals of the SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished research. The extended abstract must be **authored solely by the student**. If the work is collaborative and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should clearly describe the student's role and focus on that portion of the work.

### Participation

The SRC consists of three rounds:

1. **Paper Round:** Submissions are reviewed by an SRC committee.
2. **Poster Round:** Accepted students present their posters to judges and conference attendees.
3. **Presentation Round:** Selected students from the poster round give a final talk to judges.
